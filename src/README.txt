Assuming you are in the directory containing this README:

## To clean:
ant -buildfile src/build.xml clean

## To compile: 
ant -buildfile src/build.xml all

## To run by specifying arguments from command line [similarly for the 2nd argument and so on ...]
## We will use this to run your code
ant -buildfile src/build.xml run -Darg0=firstarg 

## To run by specifying args in build.xml (just for debugging, not for submission)
ant -buildfile src/build.xml run

## To create tarball for submission
ant -buildfile src/build.xml tarzip

Choice of Data structure
[
    After comparison of various trees such as Avl tree and Red Black tree with Binary Search tree by inserting huge data set we found no much performance difference between them. Hence, as BST is widely used we used BST to implement this assignment.
This assignment is optimize in terms of IO operations are String manipulations.

Time Complexity: Insert: O(logn).
		  Search: O(logn).

Print Writer opens the file output.txt if available or if not present then creates new file output.txt
