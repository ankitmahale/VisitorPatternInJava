Choice of Data structure
[
    After comparison of various trees such as Avl tree and Red Black tree with Binary Search tree by inserting huge data set we found no much performance difference between them. Hence, as BST is widely used we used BST to implement this assignment.
This assignment is optimize in terms of IO operations are String manipulations.

Time Complexity: Insert: O(logn).
		  Search: O(logn).

Print Writer opens the file output.txt if available or if not present then creates new file output.txt
